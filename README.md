App for finishing Angular course @ SoftUni

The app can be used as bike rental service. It handles management of bike stations (where bikes are parked), bikes. Users can rent a bike for a trip and then return it to any station.

Stations can be - view as list, created, updated or deleted

Bikes can be view as list, created, deleted or put in service mode, or if in service mode, return to be visible for renting

Each user can see it's own trips and rent only 1 bike at a time.

On the home page there is a map with station locations an information about available bikes on each station. If the current user has started a trip on that map he can see the available spaces on each station so he know where he can leave the rented bike.
